### Contacts Expo


### Tech Stack

Vanilla JS - to show off capabilities, we're going to avoid libraries 
Helper File - pull from 
Karma + Jasmine - best to go with a simple testing framework 
Semantic UI - because it's pretty, though we could go for a custom sass layout to show how pro we are
Custom Sass - pull starter sass file because it's fun :)
Django - you know what? Fuck it... maybe use Django for the back-end calls 
FontAwesome - let's get some fancy icons in this bitch 
My own photo - why the fuck not?


### Process / Idea 

- pull in the json using json loading helper 
- create an array of objects for the contacts
- when creating a new user, add to the array of objects 
- maybe wanna use vue JS for the front end to make things simple
- for saving the file, use python on the back end 


### NOTE + TODO : 

- get the test library to read javascript from the static folder, not the src folder ;)
- update your gulp library versions and shit
